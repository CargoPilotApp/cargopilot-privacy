    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> January 18, 2026</p>

    <p>
      CargoPilot ("CargoPilot", "we", "us", or "our") provides a mobile application
      designed to help trucking and logistics professionals plan stops by sharing
      real-world tips and photos about locations. This Privacy Policy explains how
      we collect, use, and protect your information.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <p>
      When you create an account or sign in, we may collect your email address,
      a user identifier, and basic profile information you choose to provide.
    </p>

    <p><strong>User-Generated Content</strong></p>
    <p>
      When you submit tips or reviews, we collect the content you provide,
      including text, photos, selected locations, map coordinates, and timestamps.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Location Information</strong></p>
    <p>
      With your permission, CargoPilot may access your device location to show
      your position on the map, help find nearby locations, and improve the
      accuracy of location-based features.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Usage and Diagnostic Data</strong></p>
    <p>
      We may collect limited diagnostic and performance information to improve
      app reliability and user experience.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and maintain the CargoPilot app</li>
      <li>To display community-submitted tips and photos</li>
      <li>To support map and location-based features</li>
      <li>To improve app performance and reliability</li>
      <li>To protect users and prevent misuse</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      CargoPilot does not sell personal information. We may share data with
      trusted service providers that help operate the app (such as cloud hosting
      and authentication services), or when required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Public Content</h2>
    <p>
      Tips and photos you submit may be visible to other users. Please avoid
      sharing sensitive or personal information in public content.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information as long as necessary to provide the service and
      operate the app. Content may remain available unless removed or restricted
      for policy or safety reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can control permissions (location, camera, photos) through your device
      settings. You may request account or data deletion by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no system is
      completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      CargoPilot is intended for use by adults and logistics professionals and is not directed toward individuals under the age of 18. We do not
      knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on
      this page with an updated effective date.
